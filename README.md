# Final Project Rubric

## Project Description 

Everyone in the class is expected work on a project and present it at the end of the semester. This is in place of the final examination and presentations will be held at the time and location of the scheduled final exam for the class. You can work individually or in groups of up to 3 students.

### Topic

The topic of the project is (almost) entirely up to you. While I advise you to choose one of the preselected project topics, you are free to propose your own. If I think your idea is not complex enough, or even too complex, I will veto it and let you know.

#### Suggested Topics

* Conway's Game of Life
* Abelian Sandpile Model
* Rigid Bodies and Colliders
* Fractal Flame Algorithm

#### Other Topics Done in the Past

* RSA Encryption/Decryption
* 3D Mesh Viewer/Renderer
* Text-based Games

### Grading

#### Core Requirements

* Code is submitted through GitHub
* A written report is required
  * This should be about a page, and should be provided as a file named README.md with your code
  * This report should detail the project, challenges encountered, results, and possible improvements.
* The project shall compile on clamshell.rutgers.edu. 
* The project shall execute on clamshell.rutgers.edu.

| Compilation      | Compiles | N/A | N/A | N/A | Does not compile | 6 |
| Execution        | No Errors | Fails 1+ tests | Fails 2+ tests | Fails 3+ tests | Fails all tests or no tests provided | 13 |

| Presentation     | Report is complete and presented | * | ** | *** | Missing Report or Presentation | 4 |

\* Report and presentation are given, but key details are missing (e.g. improvements to make)

\*\* Report and presentation are given, not only are key details missing, but project understanding is lacking

\*\*\* Report and presentation are given poorly, obvious lack of project topic understanding

## Academic Integrity

Many implementations already exist freely on the internet; you may look at them, but you must site them as sources, **failure to do so is plagiarism**.
